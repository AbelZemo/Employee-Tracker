# PSQL Challenge: Employee Tracker

# Description:

build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

        GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
        WHEN I start the application
        THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
        WHEN I choose to view all departments
        THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
        WHEN I choose to view all roles
        THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
        WHEN I choose to view all employees
        THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
        WHEN I choose to add a department
        THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
        WHEN I choose to add a role
        THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
        WHEN I choose to add an employee
        THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
        WHEN I choose to update an employee role
        THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database
